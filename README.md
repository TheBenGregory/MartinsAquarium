07/12 NOTES: Currently struggling with consistent flexbox. Tonights plan is to review flexbox yet again, find some instructional videos and work through them. Primary difficulty is with classes and knowing which ones to affect with flexbox. Currently my css is affecting my HTML as seen in the different color contatiners. 

Feel comfrotable/confident with HTML at this stage, what I don't know I can find easily and I understand how to insert into the document. 

I understand how css is structured, I understand what flexbox SHOULD do but I am unable to consistenly make it happen at this point and often find myself hunting and pecking for solutions.
